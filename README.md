 This includes an overview of the project, including basic technologies used in system, software and hardware. 
 The use of v2v and v2i technologies have been underlined in this chapter. How the use of v2i system is inculcated in this project is also been focused here.
In V2I, the infrastructure plays a coordination role by gathering global or local information on traﬃc and road conditions and then suggesting or
imposing certain behaviours on a group of vehicles. In a more sophisticated scenario, the velocities and accelerations of vehicles and inter vehicle distances would be suggested by
the infrastructure on the basis of traﬃc conditions, with the goal of optimizing overall emissions, fuel consumption, and traﬃc velocities.
Suggestions to vehicles could be broadcast to drivers via road displays or directly to vehicles via wireless connections. Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communications for 
Safety is the wireless exchange of critical safety and operational data between vehicles and roadway infrastructure, intended primarily to avoid motor vehicle crashes.
Vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications for safety is a key research program of the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Oﬃce (ITS JPO) program within the
U.S. Department of Transportations (U.S. DOT) Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA).

In V2I, the infrastructure plays a coordination role by gathering global or local information on traﬃc and road conditions and then suggesting or imposing certain behaviours
on a group of vehicles. One example is ramp metering, already widely used, which requires limited sensors and actuators (measurements of traﬃc density on ahighway and traﬃc lights
on ramps). In a more sophisticated scenario, the velocities and accelerations of vehicles and inter vehicle distances would be suggested by the infrastructure on the basis of traﬃc
conditions, with the goal of optimizing overall emissions, fuel consumption, and traﬃc velocities. Suggestions to vehicles could be broadcast to drivers via road displays or 
directly to vehicles via wireless connections. Looking further ahead, in some cases suggestions could be integrated into the vehicle controls and implemented semi automatically
(always taking onto account the restrictions on automatic vehicle driving imposed by the Vienna Convention on Road Traﬃc, discussed later).As far as V2I communication is concerned,
the reported performance results are overly optimistic due to the fact that both models discussed therein unrealistically assumed that all of the SUs present at the time the 
snapshot was taken will successfully complete their service. In reality, vehicles, being mobile, they reside within the coverage range of S for a limited period of time and
then depart. Thus, any request associated with a vehicle that went out of range has to be discarded. Moreover, the two models assume single request generation per arriving vehicle.
However, an arriving vehicle may generate a randomly-sized bulk of requests. This is especially true since several passengers may be travelling on board of an arbitrary vehicle and
each one of these passengers may independently require access. The M/M/m and M/G/m models fail to capture these particular aspects.

1 Applications
The safety applications aim to decrease the number of accident by prediction and notifying the drivers of the information obtained through the communications between the vehicles
and sensors installed on the road.
1. Warning for hazardous situations (such as congestions, accidents, obstacles etc.),
2. Merging assistance, 
3. Intersection safety,
4. Speed management, 
5. Rail crossing operations,
6. Priority assignment for emergency vehicles.


2. Advantages
1.Consistent and Smoother i.e The performance indicators showed that the driver behaviour changed and became more consistent and smother.
2.Traﬃc Safety i.e Evaluate the impact of V2I communication on improving driver behaviour.
3.Mobility i.e The ability to improve traﬃc safety and mobility while reducing environmental impacts.

3. Limitations
1.When road width is small, Frequent sensing takes place.
2.When traﬃc is more there is sensing from both sensors.

4. Conclusion
We have presented V2I-based traﬃc management system with a two fold objective: First, our approach proposes a solution to the problem of regulating trafc ow in urban areas, 
in which diﬀerent bottleneck situations may coexist.
Second  ITS based System to improve safety of vehicle and improve user diving experience, it contributes to avoiding accidents by alerting the driver in advance of potential collisions.
The system includes an intelligent controller that uses a reference safety distance and the appropriate speed as fuzzy inputs.
The output sent to the driver is information on how the vehicle is being driven.
